Design Errors/Warnings

WARNING - map: C:/Kevan/A3041/P3041/P3041.lpf(16): Semantic error in "USE DOUT
     TRUE CELL "xdac_1_0io[1]" ;": Block "xdac_1_0io[1]" of DOUT "xdac_1_0io[1]"
     cannot be found in design. This preference has been disabled.
WARNING - map: The JTAG port has been disabled in this project and JTAG pins
     will be configured as General Purpose IO.  You have to use JTAGENB pin in
     hardware to change the personality of the port from JTAG pins to general
     purpose IO.  Reference MachXO2 Handbook for details on dual function JTAG
     port.
WARNING - map: All configuration ports of the design have been disabled.
     Reference MachXO2 Handbook for information on the Configuration Ports of
     MachXO2
WARNING - map: Using local reset signal 'RESET_1' to infer global GSR net.
WARNING - map: BANDGAP turned off dynamically by Power controller
     'Power_Controller/PCNTR_Inst0'. When the BANDGAP circuitry is turned off,
     POR circuitry, analog circuits PLL, oscillator, Inputs (MIPI, SSTLXX,
     HSTL18, LVCMOSXXD, SSTLXXD,HSTL18D, LVTTL33D, LVCMOSXXRXX, LVDS25, RSDS25,

WARNING - map: POR turned off dynamically by Power controller
     'Power_Controller/PCNTR_Inst0'. POR is only released when SFLAG is cleared.
WARNING - map: The reset of EBR 'Command_Memory/CMD_RAM_0_0_0_0' cannot be
     controlled. The local reset is not connected to any control signal and set
     to GND. The global reset is disabled via GSR property. To control the EBR
     reset, either connect the local reset to a control signal or force the GSR
     property to be enabled.

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'RESET_1' of the design has been inferred as Global
        Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is 'RESET_1'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

     Components on inferred reset domain with GSR Property disabled
--------------------------------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED and are on the
     inferred reset domain. The components will respond to the reset signal
     'RESET_1' via the local reset on the component and not the GSR component.

   Register = 19 
   DP8KC = 5
