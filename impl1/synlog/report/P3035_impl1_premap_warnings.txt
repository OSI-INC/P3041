@W: MT531 :"c:\kevan\a3041\p3041\osr8v1r1.vhd":1168:2:1168:3|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including CPU.alu_cin.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\kevan\a3041\p3041\p3035a_ram.vhd":161:4:161:21|Found inferred clock main|RCK which controls 333 sequential elements including RAM.P3035A_RAM_0_0_0_5. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\kevan\a3041\p3041\entities.vhd":65:2:65:3|Found inferred clock ring_oscillator|RIN which controls 5 sequential elements including Fast_CK.count[3:0].
